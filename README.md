# Bash Interface to Memcached

For many small projects an SQL database is overkill for simple storage of values. As an alternate solution there are a number of excellent distributed in-memory caching systems that can be used.

Memcached is an simple but fast in-memory caching system that has only a dozen commands so users can get up and running in no time.

There are documented API's in most of the common programming languages, with the exception of Bash. This project addresses how to use Bash to communicate with memcached.
